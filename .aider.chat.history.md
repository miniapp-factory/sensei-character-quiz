3. Difficulty Modes
“Pick a difficulty: Easy (big hints), Normal (school + role), Hard (vague clues only). Then try to guess the character.”

4. 3-Hint Challenge
“I’ll give you only 3 hints about a Blue Archive character. Try to guess who it is.”

5. Rapid-Fire Mode
“You have 5 yes/no questions to identify the Blue Archive character I’m thinking of.”

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The following files will need to be edited or added to implement the Blue Archive guessing game, update the app metadata, and generate a logo:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – import and render the new game component.  
3. `mini-app/components/blue-archive-guessing-game.tsx` – new component that implements the game logic.  
4. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – new file describing the logo to generate.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – the description file for the logo image.

1. One player thinks of a Blue Archive character.
2. The other player tries to "guess the character "by asking questions.
3. Questions can be:

   Yes/No
    School-based
    Role/weapon/personality

4. The thinker answers each question truthfully.
5. The guesser can make a final guess anytime.

 Rules:

Only Blue Archive characters allowed.
The guesser can ask up to 10 questions (or choose your own limit).
The thinker can only answer: Yes, No, or I can’t say(if it's too revealing).
The guesser wins if they identify the character correctly.
If they fail after the limit, the thinker wins.

A stylized logo for Sensei’s Character Quiz featuring a bold, modern font for the title with a subtle illustration of a Blue Archive character silhouette in the background. The color palette should use deep blue and teal tones with accents of gold to reflect the game's theme. The design should be clean, with a slight gradient and a small icon of a question mark integrated into the text to hint at the quiz nature. The background should be a light gradient from white to a very pale blue, ensuring the logo is clear and legible on both dark and light themes.

#### apply changes  

I’m sorry, but I can’t apply any changes until you add the files you want to modify to the chat.  
Please add the following files to the chat so I can create the appropriate *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

- `mini-app/components/blue-archive-guessing-game.tsx`
- `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`

Once you add them, I’ll provide the blocks.

> mini-app/components/blue-archive-guessing-game.tsx  
> Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

I see you’ve added the component file.  
To finish the requested changes I’ll need to edit the following files, which are not yet in the chat:

- `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`
- `mini-app/app/page.tsx`
- `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`

Please add those files to the chat so I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo for Sensei’s Character Quiz featuring a bold, modern font for the title with a subtle illustration of a Blue Archive character silhouette in the background. The color palette should use deep blue and teal tones with accents of gold to reflect the game's theme. The design should be clean, with a slight gradient and a small icon of a question mark integrated into the text to hint at the quiz nature. The background should be a light gradient from white to a very pale blue, ensuring the logo is clear and legible on both dark and light themes.
