A stylized logo for Sensei’s Character Quiz featuring a bold, modern font for the title with a subtle illustration of a Blue Archive character silhouette in the background. The color palette should use deep blue and teal tones with accents of gold to reflect the game's theme. The design should be clean, with a slight gradient and a small icon of a question mark integrated into the text to hint at the quiz nature. The background should be a light gradient from white to a very pale blue, ensuring the logo is clear and legible on both dark and light themes.
